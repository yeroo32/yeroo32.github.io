                    <p>Mobile RPGs have come a long way from their humble beginnings. Modern titles like Honkai: Star Rail, Raid: Shadow Legends, and AFK Arena offer deep progression systems, compelling narratives, and stunning visuals that were once exclusive to PC and console.</p>
                    <p>What makes these games special is how they adapt RPG mechanics to mobile play sessions. Auto-battle features, sweep functions, and idle progression allow players to make meaningful progress even with short play sessions, while still offering manual control for those who want deeper engagement.</p>
                    <p>The gacha system, while controversial, has enabled developers to continuously update these games with new content for years. When implemented fairly, it creates a live service model that keeps communities engaged and gives players regular reasons to return.</p>
